## What Sets Us Apart

🔥 **Inspired by [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), We Offer Something Unique**

We draw inspiration from the groundbreaking work of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), who introduced the concept of a flexible, non-dependency-based component collection. This innovative approach to component development is the foundation of our collection for React Native.

🧩 **Pick What You Need, Customize as You Wish**

Choose the components that suit your project's requirements. No more bloated packages or unnecessary dependencies. You have the freedom to handpick the building blocks of your app.

🎨 **Make It Your Own**

Once you've copied and pasted the code into your project, you're in control. Customize these components to match your design, branding, and functionality. The code is yours, so let your creativity run wild!

📦 **No npm, No Hassle**

You won't find us on npm. There's no need to worry about version compatibility, package management, or dependency headaches. We keep it simple: copy, paste, and you're good to go.

🛠️ **A Resource for Building Your Own Component Libraries**

Think of our collection as more than just a resource for immediate use. Use it as a reference to learn, grow, and build your own component libraries. With our components as a foundation, you can take your development skills to the next level.
