# React Native - Installation

If you're using Bare React Native setup for your project, integrating our component collection is a breeze. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Create or Open Your React Native Project

Ensure you have an existing React Native project, or create a new one ([link](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)) if you haven't already.

### 2. Install NativeWind v4

Follow the [installation guide](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/getting-started/react-native) to install NativeWind in your project.

### 3. Metro Config

To support CommonJS (cjs) and ES modules (mjs) libraries, add the following code snippet to your `metro.config.js`:

```javascript
// ...
config.resolver.sourceExts = process.env.RN_SRC_EXT
  ? [...process.env.RN_SRC_EXT.split(',').concat(config.resolver.sourceExts), 'cjs', 'mjs']
  : [...config.resolver.sourceExts, 'cjs', 'mjs'];

// ...
module.exports = config;
```

For a working example feel free to check out our [Metro Config](https://github.com/nodegram/nativeflare/blob/751b69ef12a45ba553002d2954519c8cf1106669/apps/expo-demo/metro.config.js#L24-L26).
