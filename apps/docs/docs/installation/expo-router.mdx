# Expo Router - Installation

If you're using Expo for your project, integrating our component collection is a breeze. Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Create or Open Your Expo Project

Ensure you have an existing Expo project, or create a new one using `expo init` if you haven't already.

### 2. Expo Router Installation

To make the most out of our components, you'll need to set up the Expo Router. Please follow the Expo Router installation guide at [Expo Router Guide](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/getting-started/expo-router) to set it up in your project.

### 3. Install NativeWind v4

Follow the [installation guide](https://www.nativewind.dev/v4/getting-started/react-native) to install NativeWind in your project.

### 4. Metro Config

To support CommonJS (cjs) and ES modules (mjs) libraries, add the following code snippet to your `metro.config.js`:

```javascript
// ...
config.resolver.sourceExts = process.env.RN_SRC_EXT
  ? [...process.env.RN_SRC_EXT.split(',').concat(config.resolver.sourceExts), 'cjs', 'mjs']
  : [...config.resolver.sourceExts, 'cjs', 'mjs'];

// ...
module.exports = config;
```
